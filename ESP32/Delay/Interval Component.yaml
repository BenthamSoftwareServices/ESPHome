This component allows you to run actions at fixed time intervals. For example, if you want to toggle a switch every minute, you can use this component. Please note that itâ€™s possible to achieve the same thing with the time.on_time trigger, but this technique is more light-weight and user-friendly.

# Example configuration entry
interval:
  - interval: 1min
    then:
      - switch.toggle: relay_1
If a startup delay is configured, the first execution of the actions will not occur before at least that time after boot.

Configuration variables:
interval (Required, Time): The interval to execute the action with.

startup_delay (Optional, Time): An optional startup delay - defaults to zero.

then (Required, Action): The action to perform.

some_config_option:
  interval: 1000us  # 1000 microseconds = 1ms
  interval: 1000ms  # 1000 milliseconds
  interval: 1.5s  # 1.5 seconds
  interval: 0.5min  # half a minute
  interval: 2h  # 2 hours
