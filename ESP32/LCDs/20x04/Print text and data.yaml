# I²C configuration (pins depend on your ESP32 board, default GPIO21 and GPIO22)
i2c:
  scl: 8
  sda: 7
  scan: False # Set to true if I2C address not known
  id: bus_a
  # Set the frequency the I²C bus should operate on. Defaults to 50kHz. Values are 10kHz, 50kHz, 100kHz, 200kHz, … 800kHz
  frequency: 25kHz # Higher frequencies avoid error message: Component display took a long time for an operation (204 ms). Components should block for at most 30 ms.
  # Increase the allowable time for an I2C response if slave device has slow datasheet timing parameters; not the same as a functionally slow device.  Defaults to 50mS
  timeout: 100ms
